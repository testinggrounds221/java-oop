Define interface GradeSheet with:
    Member functions:
        printGradeCard(),getGradePoint(char c),getGradeInput(),calculateGPA()
	calculateGPA():
		try the block for errors:
			sumCT <- credits * gradePoint for every enrolled course
			gpa <- sumCT/sum of all credits
		catch if exception occurs:
			Print the exception	
			exit
	getGradeInput():
		try the block for errors:
			Get credits and marks for every course
		catch if exception occurs:
			Print the exception	
			exit

Define interface Tutee with:
    Member functions:
        getStudentInput() printStudentInfo()

Define class GradeStudent that implements both GradeSheet and Scholar:
    data Members:
        sub_marks,credits,sub_grades,total,
        overall_grade,no_crs,gpa,name,reg_no,in,
    Member functions:
        same as the implemented interfaces

    Main function:
        getStudentInput
        getGradeInput
        calculateGPA
		printGradeCard
