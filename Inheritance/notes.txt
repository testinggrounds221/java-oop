TYPES =>	single, multilevel and hierarchical (IN JAVA)
			multiple(extend more than 1) and hybrid(descendant of multiple) (not directly but through interface)

single : class inherits another class <TestInheritance.java>
multilevel : a chain of inheritance <TestInheritance2.java>
hierarchical : When two or more classes inherits a single class <TestInheritance3.java>

Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?
To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes.
The C class inherits A and B classes.
If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class object,
there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.

MENTION super()
